"In 2014, an estimated 30,000 Central American children seeking refuge from "
"violence in their home countries have arrived in the United States. As a "
"state and a nation, we have a humanitarian responsibility to provide family-"
"based care for vulnerable children, wherever they come from. These children "
"deserve the chance to learn, to feel safe at night, and to live the life of "
"a kid while they go through this unique federal legal process."

"Through July 31, 2,804 children have been placed with sponsors living in "
"Maryland. This represents roughly 7.5%% of the total number of children who "
"have been released to sponsors throughout the United States, a larger than "
"normal share due to Maryland’s large population of immigrants from El "
"Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Governor O’Malley has called on the "
"people of Maryland to come together and ensure these children have their "
"basic human needs met, have a safe home environment and the resources they "
"need while they go through the next steps in the federal process."

"state government departments to care for the children when they arrive in "
"Maryland. Buscando is the bridge between organizations with capacity and the "

"While this is a federally managed program and we do not know how many "
