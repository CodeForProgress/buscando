		<h2>Buscando</h2>

		<p>Buscando is a place for service organizations and host families of Central American children seeking refuge to meet local needs with local services.</p>

		<p>So far this year, more than 57,000 children, fleeing violence in Central America, entered the United States seeking refuge. Officials estimate that 90,000 children will arrive by yearâ€™s end. As a nation, we have a humanitarian responsibility to provide family-based care for vulnerable children, wherever they come from. These children need to be with families that care, not institutionalized in barracks. The top priority is reunification of refugee children with family members here in the U.S. Where this is not possible, we need to place children in the federal foster care system.</p>

		<p> 2,205 of the children fleeing violence in Central America arrived in Maryland between January 1 and July 7, 2014. Most of these children come from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Many people from these countries live in Maryland, and in fact, most of the children in Maryland who sought refuge have been brought to family members already in the state.</p>

		<p>Wherever they are placed, these children will need access to the resources available in their communities. The issue is so large that no one organization, including the federal government, can manage it alone. It requires the combined resources of a multitude of community service, faith-based, and government organizations to provide care for these children.</p>

		<p>In an effort to assist reunited families and those who have yet to be placed, as well as to prepare for new arrivals, a massive collaborative effort is taking place across Maryland. But this effort requires an accessible bridge between organizations with capacity and the children and families who need assistance.</p>

		<p>That is why a volunteer collective of DC-area technologists created Buscando, a technological tool to support coordinated efforts across community groups and state departments to care for Central American children seeking refuge when they arrive in Maryland.</p>
